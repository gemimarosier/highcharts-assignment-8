<h1>Gang Presence and Illegal Drug Use in U.S. School Systems</h1>

<p>By Gemima Rosier</p>

<p> Many reports support the correlation of illegal drug use and gang presence in schools. A common practice in gangs is the obtaining and distribution of illegal drugs. According to a national survey of American attitudes on substance abuse taken in 2010, students enrolled in schools with gangs were five times more likely to use marijuana and 12 times more likely to use tobacco. Thus, the following charts display a common trend. The study also stated students are three times more likely to be able to get drugs within an hour if they attending schools with gang activity. Addressing gang activity can be a route to minimizing the use the illegal drugs by adolescents. </p>
